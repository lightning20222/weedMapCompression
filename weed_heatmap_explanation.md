# Drone-Based Weed Density Analysis: Data Compression & Aggregation

This document outlines the efficient method for processing drone-captured weed mask images to generate a robust, farm-wide weed density map. The core strategy involves significant **data compression** at the drone level, followed by **ensemble averaging** at the server to enhance reliability.

## 1. Motivation: Efficiency Through Compression

The raw data is a **full mask image (512×512 pixels)**, representing 262,144 data points per drone. Transmitting this full image is inefficient, wasting bandwidth and slowing real-time analysis.

**Goal:** Compress this information by focusing only on the weed density, achieving a massive data reduction while retaining the essential field information.

## 2. Heatmap Generation (Data Compression)

Each drone transforms its 512×512 mask into a small **$20 \times 20$ heatmap**, reducing the data from 262,144 values to just 400 values—a **99.85% reduction**.

### Compression Steps

1.  **Grid Split:** The $512 \times 512$ mask is divided into a $20 \times 20$ grid, creating 400 cells.
2.  **Density Calculation:** In each cell, the average weed pixel intensity (weed pixel count / total pixel count) is computed.
3.  **Normalization:** The cell average is normalized between 0 (no weeds) and 1 (full weeds).

**Formula for Heatmap Cell $(i, j)$:**

$$
\text{heatmap}[i,j] = \frac{1}{255} \cdot \frac{1}{|C_{i,j}|} \sum_{(y,x) \in C_{i,j}} \text{mask}[y,x]
$$

* Where $C_{i,j}$ is the pixel set inside cell $(i, j)$, and $|C_{i,j}|$ is the number of pixels in that cell.

**Analogy:** This is like taking a high-resolution satellite photo and dividing the farmland into a **$20 \times 20$ chessboard**, then calculating and sending only "how green (weedy) is each square?"

## 3. Aggregation Across Drones (Noise Reduction)

Each drone sends its $20 \times 20$ density map to the central server. The final farm-wide map is created using **ensemble averaging**.

**Process:** We average the heatmaps from all $N$ drones that viewed a section of the field.

**Formula for Farm Heatmap:**

$$
\text{farm\_heatmap} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^{N} \text{heatmap}_k
$$

* Where $N$ is the number of drones, and $\text{heatmap}_k$ is the map from drone $k$.

**Benefit:** Averaging the opinions of multiple drones reduces noise, minimizes the impact of packet loss, and ensures the final farm-wide map is **more robust** and reliable—just like averaging multiple measurements in a scientific experiment.

## 4. How to Explain Verbally

“Each drone compresses its mask into a simple 20×20 density map — like reducing a high-resolution image into a low-resolution summary.”

“This is efficient because we only care about density of weeds, not the exact pixel values.”

“When we combine multiple drones, we average their heatmaps. This ensures the final farm-wide map is more robust, just like averaging multiple measurements in an experiment to reduce error.”

## 5. Analogy for Professor

Heatmap generation: Like taking a satellite photo and dividing farmland into a chessboard, then asking “how green is each square?”

Aggregation: Like having multiple satellites look at the same field and then averaging their answers to get the most reliable picture.
